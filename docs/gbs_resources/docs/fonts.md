|---|---|
|Dotton_Font_jaJP|In-game sample|

This is a Japanese font that Dr. Dotton worked even harder to create. By slightly sacrificing the readability of the original Dotton Font, unnecessary glyphs were removed to allow for tighter letter spacing, resulting in a sleek, ultimate design. Enjoy!

### Bitton Font jaJP
[Download](/gbs/fonts/Bitton_Font_jaJP.zip)

| <img src={Bitton_Font_jaJP} style={{width: 200}} alt="Bitton_Font_jaJP" /> | <img src={bitton_font_sample} style={{width: 300}} alt="bitton_font_sample" /> |
|---|---|
|Bitton_Font_jaJP|In-game sample|

This Japanese font was created with great effort by Bitton. Since it’s only 3 Bittons wide (3 x 4 pixels), the readability is quite poor. However, the alphanumeric characters, symbols, and katakana might be barely legible. As for the hiragana, it seems like only Bitton, the creator, can decipher them.
