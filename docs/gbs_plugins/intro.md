# Overview

This document provides details of the experimental GB Studio 4 custom made plugin collections: [GB Studio XV Plugins](https://github.com/tomo666/gb-studio-xv-plugins)

These plugins are byproducts of the game “XV” I’m currently developing and provides functionality that cannot be accomplished or are difficult to implement using just the built-in event components (as of GB Studio version 4.1).

Usability might not be straight forward and might be difficult understanding the concepts, but if it can be of any good usage depending on your needs, please feel free to use/customize it. Can be used in commercial or non-commercial purposes. However, these plugins are highly experimental and can be removed/updated in the future without prior notices. Also, issue fixes and additional features are not guaranteed to be implemented unless I feel the need to be updated. So please use it at your own risk.

No need for credits, but if you would like to do so, please use: [Tomo@indiegdevstdio](https://x.com/indiegdevstdio) or just Tomo.
